At the beginning of 2023 I discovered sketchnotes. Visual Learning is exciting and I love to draw and learn!! :D I am lucky to work:
* in a diverse team, where the designers shared my insterests and nurtured them
* in a company that values creativity and allows you to grow it

That is how, I joined IBM's DACH sketchnoting crew, where we gather everyweek to draw! These are some of my outcomes:
