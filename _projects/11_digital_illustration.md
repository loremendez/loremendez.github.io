I have always liked to draw, but when I was studying at the university, everything that was not related to science suddenly seemed pointless. I stopped reading literature, drawing, learning how to play the keyboard, and every other activity that was distracting me from studies.

It took me a few years to get drawing back to my life, but now I experiment with many things. I started at the beginning of 2023, and these are some things that I have done so far! :)

I started with the creation of a cartoon-version of myself using my favorite color :) just illustrating my thoughts.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/green_thoughts.png" title="thoughts" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/green_language.png" title="language" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/green_dance.png" title="dance" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I continued drawing my dog, Simona:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/Simona_sleep.png" title="Simona" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/Simona_grub.png" title="grub" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/Simona_bee.png" title="sprig" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

And doing some fan arts and drawing-in-your-style challenges:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/dtiys_fairy.png" title="Simona" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/dtiys_mickey.png" title="grub" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/illustration/Powerpuffgirls.png" title="sprig" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I do something artistic everyday, and sometimes publish it in my instagram account @loreingreen :)
