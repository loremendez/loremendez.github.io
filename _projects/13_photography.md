I started taking pictures back in 2015. My style is very geometric and sometimes minimalist :) I uploaded just a glimpse of my photos. I used to publish often in my instagram account, but I quit photography in 2019.

**Type of Photo:** my main focus was street photography, but I did sometimes portraits, architecture and landscapes.

**Equipment:** I started with a Fuji x100 with a 35mm lens that I borrowed from my mom, then my dad gave my a Nikon D500 for which I had some lenses in the range of 18mm to 55mm. The Fuji was great for street photography, while the Nikon was awesome for landscapes. Now, I take photos with my phone, which is practical, but only for personal purposes.

**Influences:** Henri Cartier Bresson, Vivian Maier, Chema Madoz, <a href="https://www.thomasleuthard.com/">Thomas Leuthard</a>, <a href="http://marielaigneau.com/">Marie Laigneau</a>, <a href="http://www.franciscomata.com.mx/">Francisco Mata Rosas</a>.

**Why I quit photography:** I found very difficult in Europe to do street photography with the cellphone, since it is not very discrete. My Nikon is also the opposite of discrete and nobody wanted to buy it since it is old. The best would have been bto buy a Fuji or a Leica, but I could not afford it since I was a student with a student's loan to pay. I finished to pay my loan at the end of May 2023 :) I am waiting to have some savings and I may be getting a second hand camera.
