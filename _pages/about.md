I studied BSc. in Physics and Mathematics in the National Polythecnic Institute of Mexico. I fell in love with pure Mathematics, in particular with Topology. I discovered that all the shapes have an algorithmic beauty. I wrote my Bachelor thesis about Michael Barnsley's SuperFractals, and decided that my Master's Topic was going to be Algebraic Topology.





am a Stanford ICME graduate, YC Alumni, and the VP of Engineering at Smile Identity. Previously, I was the co-founder and CTO of Arthena, co-founder of Matroid, and worked at Planet and Facebook.

I am the VP of Engineering at Smile Identity, where I work on tools that have helped over 60,000,000 people in Africa gain access to financial services. Before Smile, I was the co-founder & CTO of Arthena and a co-founder of Matroid. In my spare time, I invest in people and ideas through a small venture fund. I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
