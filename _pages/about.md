I studied my BSc. in Physics and Mathematics in Mexico. I fell in love with pure Mathematics, in particular with Topology. I discovered that all the shapes have an algorithmic beauty. I wrote my Bachelor's thesis about Michael Barnsley's SuperFractals.

After my BSc. I worked as a Category Development Specialist at Walmart, and as a Credit Risk Analyst in HSBC, until it was time to move to Germany to study my MSc. in Mathematics at the Technical University of Munich.

During my studies I focused on Machine Learning (ML), and I had the opportunity to train ML models for Capital Bay, and BMW. I wrote my Master's thesis in Computational Biology about gene regulatory networks.

Now, I work as a Data Scientist / AI Engineer at IBM, and in my free time I keep nurturing my passion for shapes drawing about anything, but mostly about my beautiful dog, Simona :)

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
